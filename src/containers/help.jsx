                            <p>There are three parts involved in setting up your event calendar.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Linking Event Calendar App with your Apple, Google or Outlook calendar.</li>
                                <li>Building your calendar and deciding how it will look.</li>
                                <li>Integrating the calendar onto your website.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>All of these steps have been designed to be as easy as possible and it is likely that you will be able to complete them without any documentation at all. However, if you get stuck at any point then this documentation will help.</p>

                            <h2 id="linking">Linking to your calendar</h2>

                            <p>After registering you will be served the &lsquo;link your calendar&rsquo; page. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t do anything unless you grant us permission to view your calendar.</p>

                            <p>We will never edit your calendar or add any events to it.</p>

                            <p>To link your calendar, simply click the link my calendar button and you will be taken to Cronofy (a separate service that we use) to grant let us view the events in your calendar.</p>

                            <p>Once you have completed this you will be taken to your Dashboard.
                            </p>

                            <p>Congratulations, you&rsquo;ve granted us permission to use your calendars and you&rsquo;re ready to create your calendar.</p>

                            <p>This part of the process is super, simple. All you need to do is tell us which of your calendars you would like us to use and display on your website. You can do this by using the options at the top.
                            </p>

                            <p>At first, your calendar will be empty as you haven&rsquo;t told Event Calendar App to use any of your calendars.

                            <p>To add your calendar to your website simply copy and paste your embed code to any web page.
                            </p>

                            <p>If you paste your code onto your site and you see it as plain text then you need to make sure that you paste it while your editor is in &lsquo;HTML&rsquo; mode.
                            </p>

                            <p>Event Calendar App will work on any web platform imaginable, however it is difficult to supply instructions for all of these. If you have any problems what so ever then please contact <a href="mailto:support@eventcalendarapp.com">support@eventcalendarapp.com</a>.

                            <p>We&rsquo;ve designed Event Calendar App to be as simple as possible to install on your Shopify site.

                            <h2 id="shopify-integrate">How to integrate your calendar onto your shop.</h2>

                            <p>It may help to read the following two sections first:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="#linking">Linking to your calendar</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#creating">Creating your calendar</a></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>These steps are not Shopify specific and are documented previously. However, they will enable you to set up your calendar and find your integration code.</p>

                            <p><strong>1) Login to your shopify admin panel</strong></p>

                            {this.props.appState && this.props.appState.user && this.props.appState.user.shopifyUser &&
                                <p><a href={`http://${this.props.appState.user.shopifyUser}/admin`}>Click here</a> to log into your admin panel. It may ask you for your shopify username and password.</p>
                            }

                            <p><strong>2) Find the page you want to add the calendar too</strong></p>

                            {this.props.appState && this.props.appState.user && this.props.appState.user.shopifyUser &&
                                <p><a href={`http://${this.props.appState.user.shopifyUser}/admin`}>Click here</a> to view all the pages on your admin store. Otherwise to do it manually...</p>
                            }

                            <p>To access your pages, on the left hand side of your admin panel, under sales channels, you will see a link called <strong>Online Store</strong>. Click on that.</p>

                            <p>You will now see a list of options for your store. Click on <strong>pages</strong>.</p>

                            <img className="gif-image" alt="integrating calendar with shopify gif" src="/images/docs/navigating-admin.gif"></img>

                            <p>You will now see a list of pages that are present on your current store. You may want to add the calendar to a current page or create a new page for it. A common scenario is to add an events page.</p>

                            <p>If you would like to add a page, click on Add page in the top right hand corner. If the page already exists that you want to add the calendar to, then click on that page directly.</p>

                            <p><strong>3) Paste the calendar code onto your page</strong></p>

                            <p>All that is left to do now is to paste your Event Calendar App code into your page. Just to refresh, the code I'm refering to here is the integration code that you can get from your <a href="/dashboard">Event Calendar App dashboard.</a></p>

                            <strong>It is hugely important that the click the HTML button before you paste your embed code â€“ otherwise it will not work.</strong>

                            <img className="gif-image" alt="integrating calendar with shopify gif" src="/images/docs/integrating-shopify-opti.gif"></img>

                            <p>Once you have done that, simply click save page in the top right hand corner.</p>

                            <p>Your event calendar should now be visable on your page</p>
